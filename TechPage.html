                <p>Before your start spending your time and Money on a marker, there are few things you MUST know.
                    <ul>
                        <li>ITS NOT A TOY!. playing paintball is a lot of fun!, its a great way to loose a few kilos and
                            make great friends.
                            maybe even some life long friends, i know i made a bunch!. but a Paintball Maker is NOT a
                            TOY. it can cause serious
                            harm if missused. You should never use it outside the playing field where everyone has their
                            safety equipment on.
                        </li>
                        <li>speaking of safety,<b>ALWAYS</b> wear yours!, specially your mask. your mask should never be
                            lifted during a game
                            and you should only remove it from your face where and when its safe.</li>
                        <li>BARREL SOCK. an important safety feture of your marker. use it! it can, and often does, help
                            avoid injuries. A barrel
                            sock goes at the end of your barrel. You should place it on the barrel as soon as you screw
                            in on to your marker.
                        </li>
                        <li>ALWAYS USE CAUTION. Personaly, i treat my marker as a real firearm, and you should too!.
                            Technology on a
                            paintball marer has evolved quite a lot since it inception. The newer models tend to hold
                            air within them to
                            maintain consistency on their performancy, even when you take your Air tank off. That means
                            they can STILL FIRE a shot,
                            you should treat it as LOADED MARKER untill you degass it (see Maintenance of your equipment
                            to lear how).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Markers come in many sizes and forms, all are great fun to use, but ALL should be used with great
                    care.

                <p> What is a Paintball marker? The definition of a marker according to <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball_marker">wikipedia</a> is:
                    <ul id="definition">
                        <li>A paintball marker, also known as a paintball gun, paint gun, or marker, is the main piece
                            of paintball equipment in the sport of paintball. Markers use an expanding gas, such as
                            carbon dioxide (CO2) or compressed
                            air, to propel paintballs through the barrel and quickly strike a target. The term "marker"
                            is derived from its original use
                            as a means for forestry personnel to mark trees and ranchers to mark wandering
                            cattle.[1][2][3]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The muzzle velocity of paintball markers is approximately 90 m/s (300 ft/s). While greater
                            muzzle velocity is possible, it has been ruled unsafe for use on most commercial paintball
                            fields.
                            [4] When paintballs hit an object at high speed they
                            have the potential to cause damage; a paintball colliding with human skin, even protected by
                            cloth, may cause bruising or
                            further tissue damage. However, the damage depends on the paintball's velocity, its impact
                            angle, whether it breaks, and
                            which part of the body it hits. Because of the potential for serious soft tissue damage,
                            paintball players must wear masks
                            to protect their eyes, mouth, and ears when barrel blocking devices are not preventing
                            paintball markers from firing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most paintball markers can be disassembled into four main components: the body, hopper,
                            barrel,
                            and gas system or air tank.
                        </li>
